This is the fifth and final developer preview before the consumer release of Android 7.0 Nougat, which is scheduled for some time in Q3.</p>\n<p>There doesn't seem to be a ton of changes, but this release offers a \"near-final\" look at Android 7. Google is encouraging developers to test their apps against this version and stomp out any bugs before the final release. Android N brings <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/android-ns-multi-window-multitasking-mode-is-a-very-promising-start/\">a split screen mode</a>, a notification panel redesign, additions to Doze power saving, and a ton of other changes developers need to account for. The Play Store is already able to accept apps targeting Android N, so once the testing is done, developers are encouraged to publish their Android N apps.</p>\n<p>As usual, the Developer Preview is available via OTA update for devices in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/android/beta\">Android Beta Program</a> or you can flash a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html\">system image</a>.</p>\n</div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/the-final-android-n-developer-preview-is-out/\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/the-final-android-n-developer-preview-is-out/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"@":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"UTF-8"},"#type":"rss","#version":"2.0","title":"Ars Technica","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.

The board game world has its fair share of award ceremonies, but none is quite as prestigious or important as the SdJ. The award assures wide promotion and a healthy sales bump both in Germany and abroad; previous winners have included such undisputed classics as <em>Catan</em> and <em>Qwirkle</em>. Most of the games nominated for the 2016 prize were initially released in 2015; to be considered for the award, they needed to have been released in the German market within the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>This past weekend, we took an <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/the-2016-board-game-of-the-year-nominees-reviewed-2/1/\">exhaustive, 8,000-word look</a> at all the nominees across two categories, and we waited patiently to hear who would come out on top. The winners were announced today.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the main \"Spiel des Jahres\" award went to the word-association party game <em><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/the-2016-board-game-of-the-year-nominees-reviewed-2/3/\">Codenames</a>. </em>Released near the end of last year, <em>Codenames </em>has taken the board game world by storm; <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames\">Board Game Geek</a> users have quickly voted the title the best party game of all time (for good reason, too).

Earlier, he'd fought his way through a sandstorm in Dubai, gunning down augmented terrorists on the hunt for weapons, before being caught out by an unfortunate explosion. The convenient result (for the developers in charge of player progression at least) was that Jensen's augmentations stopped working, and the only man who could fix them was a doctor living in Prague. That's the thing about <em>Deus Ex</em>: no matter how hard you try to stick to the mission, no matter how much you want to reveal the next snippet of the story, it's there, pushing and prodding you into one of its many side quests.</p>\n</div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/deus-ex-mankind-divided-video-preview/#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/deus-ex-mankind-divided-video-preview/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"@":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"UTF-8"},"#type":"rss","#version":"2.0","title":"Ars Technica","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.

Our original story from 7/15 appears below.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the most persistent criticisms of SpaceX has been the rocket company's inability to meet its launch commitments. Talk to any of Elon Musk's competitors in the rocket and spacecraft business, and they will all say the same thing—SpaceX isn't meeting the demands of its customers. Too much pizzazz, too little substance, and so on.</p>\n<p>To some extent, this jealousy-tinged criticism is valid. In 2014, the company had about a dozen missions on its books, and it launched six times. Last year the company had as many as 17 launches planned, but an accident on June 28, 2015 forced it to stand down for nearly the entire second half of the year. SpaceX ended up making six successful launches in 2015. However, this year the company is off to a good start with six successful missions completed so far and a seventh launch planned for 12:45am ET Monday (5:45am BST) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.</p>\n<p>This flight of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket seeks to deliver the Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station with <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/spacex-crs-9-carrying-crucial-port-to-station/\">its payload</a> of 1.7 tons of supplies as well as an International Docking Adapter.

Talk to any of Elon Musk's competitors in the rocket and spacecraft business, and they will all say the same thing—SpaceX isn't meeting the demands of its customers. Too much pizzazz, too little substance, and so on.</p>\n<p>To some extent, this jealousy-tinged criticism is valid. In 2014, the company had about a dozen missions on its books, and it launched six times.
